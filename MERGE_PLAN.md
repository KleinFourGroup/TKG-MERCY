# MERCY — Manufacturing and Employee Records: Costing and Yield
## Merge & Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Author:** Matthew Kilgore  
**Status:** Implementation complete — all 13 planned steps landed as of 2026-04-19, plus Step 9.5 (vestigial `Part` attribute cleanup). Step 7 was run as sub-steps (7a correctness → 7b signature → 7c-1 asserts → 7c-2 logging → 7c-3 polish → 7d double-negation → 7e window centering); Step 13 verified the build end-to-end against real legacy ANIKA + BECKY files (see [`plan_archive/real_data_findings.md`](plan_archive/real_data_findings.md)). Post-release feature backlog requested by the team during Step 13 is tracked in §13.

## 1. Background and Motivation

Two internal desktop applications currently exist:

| App | Codename | Purpose | Version |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| Algorithmic Nexus for Information and Knowledge Analysis | **ANIKA** | Product/material inventory and part costing | 8.0 |
| Benefits of Employment Calendar for Knowledge Yield | **BECKY** | Employee HR tracking (reviews, training, PTO, attendance, notes) | 3.1 |

A third application has been requested: a **per-employee production tracker** that records how much of each part (or batch mix) an employee produces per shift per day. Because this feature inherently references data from both ANIKA (parts/mixes) and BECKY (employees), building it as a standalone third app would require either duplicating data or coupling three separate files. The right solution is to **merge all three into a single unified application and database.**

The merged application is named **MERCY** — *Manufacturing and Employee Records: Costing and Yield* — a name that captures the full scope of the unified system, echoes "Knowledge Yield" from BECKY's full title, and carries the double meaning of production yield that is central to the new tracking feature.

Both existing apps are built on the same stack — PySide6, SQLite, reportlab — and share near-identical utility modules (`table.py`, `utils.py`, `error.py`). The architectural lift of merging is moderate, and the merge is also a good opportunity to fix known technical debt.

---

## 2. Technical Inventory

### 2.1 Shared Stack

Both apps use:
- **UI:** PySide6 (Qt6 for Python)
- **Database:** SQLite (single `.db` file, loaded fully into memory)
- **Reports:** reportlab (PDF generation via canvas API)
- **Python stdlib:** `sqlite3`, `datetime`, `base64`, `os`, `sys`

Neither app has a `requirements.txt`. External dependencies are: `PySide6`, `reportlab`. *(The Excel importer in ANIKA used `openpyxl` but has been retired — see §4.)*

### 2.2 ANIKA — File Inventory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | Entry point |
| `app.py` | `MainWindow`; 6-tab layout |
| `records.py` | Data models: `Material`, `Mixture`, `Package`, `Part`, `ImportedPart`, `Globals`, `Inventory`, `Database` |
| `file_manager.py` | SQLite init/load/save; schema migration |
| `utils.py` | UI helpers, `listToString`/`stringToList` (base64 encoding) |
| `table.py` | `DBTable`/`DBTableModel` — generic `QTableView` wrapper |
| `report.py` | `PDFReport`: globals, mix, sales, and inventory reports |
| `materials_tab.py` | Materials CRUD |
| `mixtures_tab.py` | Mixtures CRUD + PDF report |
| `packaging_tab.py` | Packaging CRUD |
| `parts_tab.py` | Parts CRUD, margin calculator |
| `inventory_tab.py` | Dual-nested material + part inventory tabs |
| `globals_tab.py` | Global cost parameters |
| `error.py` | Error dialog |
| `converter.py` | **Retired** — was a one-time Excel import tool; to be deleted |

**ANIKA Database Tables:** `globals`, `materials`, `mixtures`, `packaging`, `parts`, `materialInventory`, `partInventory`

### 2.3 BECKY — File Inventory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | Entry point |
| `app.py` | `MainWindow`; 4-tab layout |
| `records.py` | Data models: `Employee`, `EmployeeReview`, `EmployeeTrainingDate`, `EmployeePoint`, `EmployeePTORange`, `EmployeeNote`, `HolidayObservance`, `Database` |
| `file_manager.py` | SQLite init/load/save; version-based migration |
| `defaults.py` | Static configuration: training types, review intervals, point values, holidays, PTO eligibility |
| `utils.py` | UI helpers, `stringToB64`/`stringFromB64`, `listToString`/`stringToList` |
| `table.py` | Identical to ANIKA |
| `report.py` | `PDFReport`: employee points, PTO, notes, incident, and active-employee reports |
| `main_tab.py` | Employee picker + sub-tab container |
| `employees_tab.py` | Employee CRUD, active/inactive, PDF report |
| `reviews_tab.py` | Review tracking |
| `training_tab.py` | Safety training tracking |
| `points_tab.py` | Attendance/disciplinary points |
| `pto_tab.py` | PTO hours: tenure base, quarterly bonuses, carryover |
| `notes_tab.py` | Incident notes |
| `holidays_tab.py` | Holiday defaults + shift-specific observances |
| `error.py` | Identical to ANIKA |

**BECKY Database Tables:** `globals`, `employees`, `reviews`, `training`, `attendance`, `PTO`, `notes`, `holidays`, `observances`

---

## 3. Current Schema — Issues to Fix

This merge is the right time to correct several accumulated technical shortcuts. The issues below are organized by severity.

### 3.1 Base64-Encoded Compound Fields (HIGH — schema change)

Both apps use a workaround of encoding lists as base64-delimited strings inside single SQLite columns. This is fragile (no referential integrity, hard to query directly, opaque if the DB is ever opened externally) and should be replaced with proper relational tables.

**ANIKA — `mixtures` table:**
```
-- Current (bad):
mixtures(name PRIMARY KEY, materials, weights)
  where materials = base64("MatA#MatB#MatC")
  and   weights   = base64("100.0#50.0#25.0")

-- Correct:
mixtures(name PRIMARY KEY)
mixture_components(mixture, material, weight, sort_order,
                   UNIQUE(mixture, material))
```

**ANIKA — `parts` table (pad and misc packaging):**
```
-- Current (bad):
parts(..., pad, padsPerBox, misc, ...)
  where pad        = base64("PadA#PadB")
  and   padsPerBox = base64("2#1")
  and   misc       = base64("MiscA")

-- Correct:
part_pads(part, pad, padsPerBox, sort_order, UNIQUE(part, pad))
part_misc(part, item, sort_order, UNIQUE(part, item))
-- then drop pad, padsPerBox, misc columns from parts
```

**BECKY — `reviews.details` and `notes.details`:**
These store plain freeform text wrapped in base64. SQLite TEXT handles newlines natively; the encoding serves no purpose. Migration: decode in-place to plain TEXT.

**BECKY — `employees.shift`:**
Currently stores `"{shift}|{fullTime}"` (e.g. `"2|1"`) as a single string.
```
-- Current (bad):
employees(..., shift, ...)   -- stores "2|1"

-- Correct:
employees(..., shift INTEGER, fullTime INTEGER, ...)
```

### 3.2 Dead / Inconsistent Fields in ANIKA `parts` Table (MEDIUM — schema change)

**Unused columns:** `Part.loading`, `Part.unloading`, `Part.inspection` are stored in the DB but explicitly marked "UNUSED" in the codebase's own `__str__` method. The global `loading` and `inspection` values (in the `globals` table) are what the cost calculations actually use. These per-part columns should be dropped.

**greenScrap — Decision: use global rate only; drop per-part column.** `Part.setProduction()` stores a per-part `greenScrap` value, but `Part.getScrap()` ignores it and uses `globals.greenScrap` instead. Per-part override adds complexity with no current benefit. The `greenScrap` column will be dropped from `parts`; the global value remains the single source of truth.

### 3.3 Incomplete `updateEmployee()` in BECKY (HIGH — logic bug)

`Database.updateEmployee()` in BECKY's `records.py` has a `# TODO` comment and only updates the keys in `employees`, `reviews`, and `notes` dicts when an employee's ID changes. The `training`, `attendance`, and `PTO` dicts are not updated, leaving dangling references. This must be fixed before the production table is added (which will also key on employee ID).

### 3.4 Non-Atomic Saves (HIGH — data integrity)

Both `file_manager.py` implementations save each table independently with individual `commit()` calls. If the app crashes mid-save, the database is left in a partially-written state with no way to roll back. The fix is to wrap the entire save in a single transaction using SQLite's context manager (`with conn:`).

### 3.5 Schema Migration by Table Count (MEDIUM — fragility)

ANIKA's `file_manager.initFile()` detects schema version by counting tables (e.g., `if len(tables) == 10`). Adding any new table breaks this logic. BECKY's approach (using `globals.db_version`) is better and should be adopted uniformly.

### 3.6 `res.executemany()` on a Consumed Cursor (MEDIUM — silent failure risk)

In both `file_manager.py` files, code like:
```python
res = self.dbFile.execute("SELECT ...")
deleted = [...]
res.executemany("DELETE ...", deleted)  # BUG: res is exhausted
```
The `executemany` call here operates on the result cursor object, not a fresh cursor. This can silently fail to delete stale rows. Fix: use `self.dbFile.executemany(...)`.

### 3.7 Assertions as Error Handling (MEDIUM — crash risk)

Both codebases use `assert` statements extensively to validate internal state (100+ occurrences). Python assertions are disabled when running with the `-O` (optimize) flag, and even when enabled they produce ugly `AssertionError` tracebacks rather than user-facing messages. Replace with explicit `raise ValueError(...)` or `raise RuntimeError(...)`.

### 3.8 Minor Issues

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `print()` instead of logging | Both, throughout | Replace with `logging` module (`logging.info`, `logging.error`) |
| Window list memory leak | `*_tab.py` in both apps | Add `Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose` attribute; stop accumulating window references |
| `not x == None` pattern | Both, throughout | Replace with `x is not None` (more Pythonic and marginally faster) |
| Magic number `2000` | ANIKA `records.py:56` | Extract as named constant `LBS_PER_TON = 2000` with explanatory comment (short ton) |
| Magic numbers `18`, `8` (ImportedPart) | ANIKA `records.py` | Moot once `ImportedPart` is removed |
| Debug `print()` in points logic | BECKY `records.py:345` | Remove |
| No `requirements.txt` | Both | Create one listing `PySide6` and `reportlab` |

---

## 4. What Gets Dropped

- **`converter.py`** (ANIKA): The Excel import was a one-time migration tool. It references `ImportedPart`, a legacy class that uses different unit conventions than the current `Part` class. Both `converter.py` and `ImportedPart` (and its `convert()` method) should be deleted. This simplifies `records.py` considerably.
- **BECKY's "Upcoming Actions" tab**: Currently a `QLabel("TODO")` placeholder. It has been evaluated and is not planned for the foreseeable future. The placeholder will be removed entirely from the merged app.
- **`base64`** serialization utilities: Once the schema normalization in §3.1 is complete, `listToString`, `stringToList`, `stringToB64`, and `stringFromB64` in `utils.py` can all be removed.

---

## 5. Proposed Unified Schema

### 5.1 Complete Table List (19 tables)

**From ANIKA (modified):**

```sql
-- Unchanged
CREATE TABLE globals(name PRIMARY KEY, value);
CREATE TABLE materials(
    name PRIMARY KEY, cost, freight,
    SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, Li2O, P2O5, Na2O, CaO, K2O, MgO, LOI, otherChem,
    Plus50, Sub50Plus100, Sub100Plus200, Sub200Plus325, Sub325
);
CREATE TABLE packaging(name PRIMARY KEY, kind, cost);
CREATE TABLE materialInventory(name, date, cost, amount, UNIQUE(name, date));
CREATE TABLE partInventory(name, date, cost, amount40, amount60, amount80, amount100, UNIQUE(name, date));

-- Replaced: mixtures flat → normalized
CREATE TABLE mixtures(name PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE TABLE mixture_components(
    mixture, material, weight REAL, sort_order INTEGER,
    UNIQUE(mixture, material)
);

-- Modified: drop pad/padsPerBox/misc/loading/unloading/inspection/greenScrap
CREATE TABLE parts(
    name PRIMARY KEY, weight, mix,
    pressing, turning,
    fireScrap,
    box, piecesPerBox, pallet, boxesPerPallet,
    price, sales
);

-- New: replaces parts.pad / parts.padsPerBox
CREATE TABLE part_pads(
    part, pad, padsPerBox INTEGER, sort_order INTEGER,
    UNIQUE(part, pad)
);

-- New: replaces parts.misc
CREATE TABLE part_misc(
    part, item, sort_order INTEGER,
    UNIQUE(part, item)
);
```

**From BECKY (modified):**

```sql
-- Modified: split shift column, remove base64 from details
CREATE TABLE employees(
    idNum PRIMARY KEY, lastName, firstName, anniversary,
    role, shift INTEGER, fullTime INTEGER,
    addressLine1, addressLine2, addressCity, addressState,
    addressZip, addressTel, addressEmail,
    status INTEGER
);
CREATE TABLE reviews(idNum, date, nextReview, details TEXT, UNIQUE(idNum, date));
CREATE TABLE training(idNum, training, date, comment, UNIQUE(idNum, training, date));
CREATE TABLE attendance(idNum, date, reason, value REAL, UNIQUE(idNum, date));
CREATE TABLE PTO(idNum, start, end, hours REAL, UNIQUE(idNum, start, end));
CREATE TABLE notes(idNum, date, time, details TEXT, UNIQUE(idNum, date, time));
CREATE TABLE holidays(holiday PRIMARY KEY, month INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE observances(holiday, shift INTEGER, date, UNIQUE(holiday, shift, date));
```

**New — production tracking:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE production(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    employeeId INTEGER,              -- FK to employees.idNum
    date TEXT,                       -- ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    shift INTEGER,                   -- 1, 2, or 3
    targetType TEXT,                 -- "part" or "mix"
    targetName TEXT,                 -- name in parts or mixtures table respectively
    action TEXT,                     -- "Batching", "Pressing", or "Finishing"
    quantity REAL,                   -- pieces for parts; lbs for mixes
    scrapQuantity REAL DEFAULT 0,    -- pieces/lbs scrapped (0 if not applicable)
    UNIQUE(employeeId, date, shift, targetType, targetName, action)
);
```

### 5.2 Globals Table Keys (unified)

```
gasCost               (from ANIKA)
batchingFactor        (from ANIKA)
laborCost             (from ANIKA)
greenScrap            (from ANIKA — single global rate; per-part override removed)
loading               (from ANIKA)
inspection            (from ANIKA)
manufacturingOverhead (from ANIKA)
SGA                   (from ANIKA)
db_version            (from BECKY — integer, incremented on each schema migration)
```

## 6. Production Tracking Design

The production tracking schema is based on the model:
**(employee, date, shift, part-or-mix, action, quantity)**

All design questions have been resolved; decisions are documented in §10.

### 6.1 "Part or Mix" — polymorphic reference

A production record can reference either a **part** (e.g., "pressed 200 of Part X") or a **mix** (e.g., "batched 1400 lbs of Mix Y"). The schema uses a discriminator pattern:
- `targetType TEXT` — `"part"` or `"mix"`
- `targetName TEXT` — the name in the `parts` or `mixtures` table respectively

This keeps the table flat and queryable without nullable FK columns.

### 6.2 Action values — fixed list

`action` is constrained to a fixed list stored in `defaults.py` (alongside `TRAINING`), preventing typos and enabling reliable report grouping:

```python
PRODUCTION_ACTIONS: list[str] = [
    "Batching",
    "Pressing",
    "Finishing",
]
```

The UI will present these as a dropdown, not a free-text field.

### 6.3 Quantity units

Per team clarification at Step 11 kickoff (2026-04-19), actions map 1:1 to target types, and units are expressed in terms of the action's natural work unit rather than the generic part/mix unit originally sketched:

- `Batching` is always against a **mix**; unit is **drops** (pressing drops).
- `Pressing` is always against a **part**; unit is **parts**.
- `Finishing` is always against a **part**; unit is **parts**.

The mapping lives in `defaults.py` as `PRODUCTION_ACTION_TARGET: dict[str, str]` (action → `"mix"`/`"part"`) and `PRODUCTION_TARGET_UNIT: dict[str, str]` (`"mix"` → `"drops"`, `"part"` → `"parts"`). `ProductionRecord.setRecord(action, targetName, …)` takes the action and derives `targetType` from the first dict; the UI uses the second dict to label the quantity field. No separate units column is needed on disk.

### 6.4 Scrap tracking

`scrapQuantity REAL DEFAULT 0` is included in the schema. It defaults to 0 so it need not be entered when not applicable, and is available for quality analysis when it is.

### 6.5 Inventory integration

Production records are **independent** of the inventory tables. The `partInventory` and `materialInventory` WIP staging values in ANIKA are not tied to production scheduling and will not be automatically updated by production entries. The two systems remain separate.

---

## 8. Migration Plan for Existing Users

### 8.1 Overview

The merged app will be able to open three kinds of `.db` files:
1. An ANIKA-format database (no employee tables)
2. A BECKY-format database (no material tables)
3. A MERCY-format database (both + production table)

Detection logic in `file_manager.initFile()`:
- Has `materials` + `parts` but no `employees` → **ANIKA DB**, run ANIKA migration
- Has `employees` + `PTO` but no `materials` → **BECKY DB**, run BECKY migration
- Has `production` table + `globals.db_version` → **MERCY DB**, check version number

### 8.2 Safety: Always Back Up First

Before any migration, the app will:
1. Copy `database.db` → `database.db.bak-YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Show the user a confirmation dialog naming the backup file
3. Run the migration in a single SQLite transaction (if anything fails, roll back entirely — the original file is untouched)

### 8.3 ANIKA Migration Steps

1. Decode `mixtures.materials` and `mixtures.weights` base64 fields
2. Create `mixture_components` table; insert decoded rows; drop `materials` and `weights` columns from `mixtures`
3. Decode `parts.pad`, `parts.padsPerBox`, `parts.misc` base64 fields
4. Create `part_pads` and `part_misc` tables; insert decoded rows
5. Recreate `parts` table without `pad`, `padsPerBox`, `misc`, `loading`, `unloading`, `inspection`, and `greenScrap` columns (SQLite requires table recreation to drop columns)
6. Create all BECKY-origin tables (empty): `employees`, `reviews`, `training`, `attendance`, `PTO`, `notes`, `holidays`, `observances`
7. Create `production` table
8. Set `globals.db_version = 1`

### 8.4 BECKY Migration Steps

1. Read `employees.shift` compound field, split into `shift` and `fullTime`
2. Recreate `employees` table with split columns; copy data
3. Decode base64 in `reviews.details` and `notes.details` → plain TEXT; update in place
4. Fix any rows where `updateEmployee()` left dangling keys in `training`, `attendance`, or `PTO` (validate FK consistency; log any orphaned rows)
5. Create all ANIKA-origin tables (empty): `materials`, `mixtures`, `mixture_components`, `packaging`, `parts`, `part_pads`, `part_misc`, `materialInventory`, `partInventory`
6. Create `production` table
7. Set `globals.db_version = 1`

### 8.5 Merging Two Existing Databases

If a user has both an ANIKA `.db` and a BECKY `.db` file with real data, the app should support a one-time merge:

1. File → *Import from BECKY database...* (or vice versa)
2. User selects the second file
3. App migrates both to MERCY format in memory
4. Imports the employee tables from the BECKY file into the already-open MERCY DB
5. The only conflict is `globals`: use ANIKA's cost parameters; the unified DB's `db_version` takes precedence
6. Save the merged result

### 8.6 Concurrency

The app will have fewer than five concurrent users. SQLite in **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode** is sufficient for this — WAL allows multiple simultaneous readers and one writer without locking contention. Enable at DB creation time:

```python
conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
```

No other infrastructure changes are needed.

---

## 9. Implementation Order

Each step leaves the app in a working state so the team can test incrementally.

| Step | Description | Risk | Testable Milestone |
|------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| **1** | Create new repo (`TKG-MERCY`). Copy ANIKA as base. Delete `converter.py` and `ImportedPart`. | Low | App works identically to ANIKA |
| **2** | Merge shared files: adopt BECKY's `utils.py` (superset); both `table.py` and `error.py` are identical | Low | No change in behavior |
| **3** | Merge `records.py`: add all BECKY model classes; unify `Database` class | Medium | Compiles; ANIKA features work |
| **4** | Merge `file_manager.py`: unified schema creation with `db_version` tracking; add WAL pragma | Medium | Can create new empty unified DB file |
| **5** | Add all BECKY tab files; wire into new tab layout in `app.py` | Medium | Both domains visible; both load/save correctly |
| **6** | Merge `report.py` | Low | All existing reports generate correctly |
| **7** | Apply tech debt fixes: assertions → exceptions, atomic saves, fix `executemany` bug, fix `updateEmployee`, replace `print` with logging, fix window cleanup | Medium | Cleaner, more robust app |
| **8** | Implement ANIKA migration (base64 normalization, column drops, table recreation) | High | Old ANIKA `.db` files open and migrate correctly |
| **9** | Implement BECKY migration (shift split, base64 decode, FK consistency check) | High | Old BECKY `.db` files open and migrate correctly |
| **10** | Implement DB merge (import second `.db` into first) | Medium | Both old databases can be combined into one |
| **11** | Implement production tracking: `ProductionRecord` in `records.py`, `PRODUCTION_ACTIONS` in `defaults.py`, `file_manager.py` additions, `production_tab.py` | Medium | New feature works end-to-end |
| **12** | Implement production reports in `report.py` | Low | Reports generate correctly |
| **13** | End-to-end testing with real data; backup/restore verification | — | Ready to ship |

---

## 10. Resolved Design Decisions

All production tracking design questions have been answered by the team lead.

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| **1** | Should `action` be free-text or a fixed list? | **Fixed list.** Values: `Batching`, `Pressing`, `Finishing`. Stored in `defaults.py` as `PRODUCTION_ACTIONS`; presented as a dropdown in the UI. |
| **2** | Should the `production` table include a `scrapQuantity` field? | **Yes**, included as `scrapQuantity REAL DEFAULT 0`. Defaults to 0 so entry is not required when not applicable. |
| **3** | Should saving a production record automatically update part WIP inventory? | **No.** The inventory staging values in ANIKA are not tied to production scheduling. The two systems remain independent. |
| **4** | Should individual parts be able to override the global green scrap rate? | **No.** All parts use `globals.greenScrap`. The unused per-part `greenScrap` column will be dropped from the `parts` table during migration. |
| **5** | Should "Upcoming Actions" (upcoming reviews, expiring training, etc.) be included? | **No.** This feature is not planned for the foreseeable future and the existing placeholder will be removed. |

## 11. Summary of Changes vs. Current Code

| Category | ANIKA change | BECKY change |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| New tables | `mixture_components`, `part_pads`, `part_misc`, `production`, all BECKY tables | all ANIKA tables, `production` |
| Modified tables | `mixtures` (drop encoded cols), `parts` (drop 7 cols), `globals` (add `db_version`) | `employees` (split `shift`), `reviews` (decode `details`), `notes` (decode `details`) |
| Deleted files | `converter.py` | — |
| Deleted classes | `ImportedPart` | — |
| Deleted utility functions | `listToString`, `stringToList` (after migration complete) | `listToString`, `stringToList`, `stringToB64`, `stringFromB64` |
| Logic fixes | `getScrap()` confirmed global-only; drop `greenScrap` from `parts` | `updateEmployee()` incomplete key updates |
| Infrastructure | Atomic saves, `db_version` migration, WAL mode | Atomic saves (already has `db_version`) |

## 12. Implementation Progress

*Last updated 2026-04-22. All 13 planned steps complete, plus the Step 9.5 polish. Step 13 verified the end-to-end path against real legacy ANIKA + BECKY files (see [`plan_archive/real_data_findings.md`](plan_archive/real_data_findings.md)). Post-release feature backlog from the team's first look at the release is tracked in §13; Steps 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20 have now landed. Each step was committed separately on `main` with a message that names the step.*

Step 7 was split into sub-steps to keep each review surface small. The hygiene sweep (7c) turned out to be large enough that it was further split into three; 7e was added when 7c-3's window-retention fix surfaced a centering regression:

- **7a** — correctness / data-integrity fixes (done).
- **7b** — promote `Database.__init__`'s optional BECKY kwargs to required args (done).
- **7c-1** — `assert` → `raise` (237 sites across the repo; judgment calls between `RuntimeError` for internal invariants vs `ValueError` for method-boundary input).
- **7c-2** — `print()` → `logging` (136 sites; 120 of them in `file_manager.py` save chatter) + drop the BECKY debug `print` in points logic.
- **7c-3** — mechanical + polish: `not x == None` → `x is not None`, window-close leak (`Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose` + parent-retention), `LBS_PER_TON` constant, `requirements.txt`.
- **7d** — clean up 2 double-negation leftovers from 7c-1.
- **7e** — restore window centering regressed by 7c-3's parent-retention change.

### 12.2 Decisions / deviations worth knowing before Step 6+

*Step-by-step implementation narratives moved to [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) on 2026-04-22 to keep this doc lean. See that file for what actually shipped for each step, and why.*

### 12.3 Known deferred issues visible in the current build

- Bare `x == None` / `x != None` residuals (not in 7c-3's scope; see [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 7c-3). Small optional follow-up.
- One awkward DeMorgan-able condition at `file_manager.py:176` / `:447` (`if not ((A is not None) and (B is not None)):`) — correct but ugly. Style-only, not blocking.
- Step 5's partial rename: `main_tab.py` → `employee_overview_tab.py` but the class is still `MainTab`. Not in Step 7's scope; see [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 5.

### 12.4 Test conventions used so far

*Historical smoke-check list moved to [`plan_archive/test_conventions.md`](plan_archive/test_conventions.md) on 2026-04-22. Live dev conventions (always-on `smoke.py` baseline, `fuzz_db.py` upkeep, headless-construction gotchas) now live in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) at repo root.*

### 12.5 Step 13 — end-to-end verification on real data (findings)

*Step 13 real-data drill findings moved to [`plan_archive/real_data_findings.md`](plan_archive/real_data_findings.md) on 2026-04-22. See that file for the five drill results and the regression hooks that remain.*

## 13. Post-release feature backlog

Requests from the team after their first look at MERCY. Each item is small enough to be one step and one commit in the §12 style; open questions resolved in-session on 2026-04-19 are recorded inline. Order is deliberate: smallest / lowest-risk first, so tomorrow's session can ship increments rather than gating the whole backlog behind the biggest item.

### 13.1 Step 14 — reports: skip save dialog, open via temp file ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-20. See [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 14 for implementation notes and deviations.

### 13.2 Step 15 — production tab refresh when an employee is deleted ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-20. See [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 15 for implementation notes and the scope decisions.

### 13.3 Step 16 — production tab: batch entry ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-20. See [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 16 for implementation notes and the scope decisions.

### 13.4 Step 17 — production hours field ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-21. Surfaced in Matthew's first post-release feedback session: the team had forgotten to include duration/hours in the production schema. One-session add — new `hours REAL DEFAULT 0` column on `production`, wired through records / save / load / table / Quick Entry / Batch Entry / all four reports. See [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 17 for implementation notes, the Case-4 stamping fix it piggybacked, and the report-formatting decisions.

### 13.5 Step 18 — productivity rate reports (feeds costing) ⏳ Planning

**Motivation.** Surfaced 2026-04-21 alongside Step 17. Team wants productivity drill-downs — rates per hour by part × action × employee × shift, with the ability to compare individuals to the fleet average. **Downstream consumer is the costing code, not HR.** They're gathering more precise labor data so they can refine the per-part cost estimates in the costing globals (the existing `pressing` / `turning` / `finishing` / etc. fields on `parts`). Not bonuses, not quotas, no targets stored on the record. This reframing matters: report shape should mirror the *inputs costing needs*, not a generic performance dashboard.

**Confirmed scope (from 2026-04-21 session).**
- Rate = `quantity / hours`, aggregated across arbitrary slices.
- Comparisons are individual-vs-average (per part, per employee). Nice-to-have, not required.
- No target-rate column or threshold storage. If "vs. expected" ever becomes desirable, the expected rate is already in costing globals.
- PDF deliverable, same `PDFReport` pipeline as the other production reports.

**Open questions — need team input before coding starts.**
1. **Aggregation math.** `sum(qty) / sum(hours)` over the window, vs. mean of per-shift rates, vs. median. These diverge whenever shifts are uneven in length or in completeness. Pick wrong and the rates mislead.
2. **Primary cut.** Probably per `(part, action)` since that's the costing-input granularity. But `(employee, part, action)` would let them see which employees are skewing the average — worth clarifying whether that's a separate report or a drill-down from the primary.
3. **Windowing.** Rolling 30 days, user-picked range, or both? Filter UI can handle either.
4. **Scrap rate.** `scrap / quantity` alongside the production rate in the same table, or a separate report?
5. **Export.** Does the team want a CSV alongside the PDF so they can paste rates into the costing globals, or is reading-and-typing fine for the first iteration?

**Tentative direction (subject to team answers).** New report type "Production Rates" as a fifth entry in `ProductionReportWindow.REPORT_TYPES`. Shape: grouped table (one row per `(part, action)`) with columns Quantity / Hours / Rate (qty/hr) / Scrap / Scrap-rate. When an employee is selected, add a "vs. average" column comparing the selected employee's rate to the fleet average for that `(part, action)`. Fleet average row at the bottom. Integrates with Step 19 (graphs) — this is the natural first customer.

**Next session pickup.** Draft two or three example reports (mocked numbers) to send the team a concrete "pick one" doc — that unsticks scope faster than open-ended questions.

### 13.6 Step 19 — graphs in reports (reportlab native) ⏳ Planning

**Motivation.** Second half of the 2026-04-21 feedback: team wants graphs alongside (or instead of) tables in the production reports.

**Confirmed decisions (2026-04-21 session).**
- **PDF only.** No dashboard pivot — the app's deliverable stays a file you can email and archive.
- **`reportlab.graphics.charts` first.** Native to the stack, zero new deps, vector into the PDF, keeps the PyInstaller binary lean. Matplotlib stays a latent escape hatch if the aesthetics fall short after seeing the first pass — decision deferred until we have team eyes on real output.

**Open questions.**
1. **Which charts, for which reports?** Bar-per-employee-per-action in Summary? Line-over-time for a per-part report? Both? Team hasn't been specific — mock examples will help.
2. **Replace tables or sit alongside?** Default: alongside, since the numbers themselves are the costing-input deliverable (§13.5). Losing them loses half the point.
3. **Styling tolerance.** `reportlab.graphics.charts` gives frumpy-but-functional output. Before we over-invest in tick customization / legend placement / color schemes, see what the team says about the first pass.

**Tentative direction.** Add chart helpers to `report.py` mirroring the existing `drawTable(data, headers)` API — e.g., `drawBarChart(groups, labels, values, title)`. Most plausible first charts:
- **Grouped bar** — one group per employee, three bars (Batching / Pressing / Finishing rate). Companions the Summary report.
- **Line over time** — one line per part, x = date, y = rate. Companions a per-part rate report.

Ship those two as exemplars inside §13.5's new "Production Rates" report, hand to the team, iterate.

**Next session pickup.** Draft one report using mock rate data with both a table and a grouped-bar chart rendered side-by-side. That's the concrete deliverable to validate the approach before scaling to the other report types.

### 13.7 Step 20 — remember last DB, prompt to reopen on startup ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-22. Fifth post-release feature item from Matthew's backlog: MERCY previously booted into an empty DB every session. Quality-of-life add — `QSettings`-backed `lastDbPath` persisted after every successful `open()`/`saveAs()`, loaded on startup via a new `MainWindow._loadPath(path) -> bool` helper, prompted through a `QMessageBox.question` in `main.py` between `window.show()` and `app.exec()`. Zero new deps (`QSettings` is already in the PySide6 stack). See [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md) Step 20 for implementation notes, the decision to keep the prompt modal every time (no "always reopen" checkbox yet), and the stale-path-silent-skip behavior.

**Follow-up still open (not part of Step 20).** Confirm with Matthew whether to also remember the last *import* path for the Import Database dialog, since that currently hard-codes `os.path.expanduser("~")`. Separate feature, separate step.

### 13.8 Dev tooling landed

Not step commits but worth cataloging so a cold pickup knows they exist:

- **`mock_reports.py`** — Step 18 planning artifact, landed 2026-04-21 (commit `5bd3433`). Generates three candidate productivity-rate-report layouts (A/hierarchical, B/flat-with-fleet-comparison, C/action-by-part matrix), each with a reportlab-native grouped bar chart. Output writes to `mock_reports/` (gitignored). Deletable once the team picks a design.
- **`fuzz_db.py`** — fake-data DB generator, landed 2026-04-22 (commit `e4246ee`). Writes a fully-populated MERCY DB through the real `FileManager.saveFile()` pipeline: every record type (materials, mixtures, packaging, parts, inventory, employees, reviews, training, attendance, PTO including CARRY/CASH/DROP, notes, holidays + observances, production) gets plausible random data. Deterministic with `--seed`; scales `tiny|small|medium|large` (medium → ~1.7k production records over 90 days). Verified end-to-end: generated DBs roundtrip through `MainWindow.loadFile()`, the Part → Mix → Material cost chain computes cleanly, `PDFReport.productionSummaryReport` renders against them, and a given seed is byte-equivalent across all 12 populated tables on re-run. Good for stress-testing any report (including Step 18's future output) without needing real team numbers.

### 13.9 Step 21 — split MERGE_PLAN.md into archive files ✅ Done

Landed 2026-04-22. This doc had grown to ~1028 lines / ~51k tokens — `Read` without `offset`/`limit` tripped the 25k-token cap. Most of that bulk was historical narrative not needed at session start.

**What moved.** §12.2 step-by-step implementation narratives → [`plan_archive/implementation_notes.md`](plan_archive/implementation_notes.md); §12.4 historical smoke-check list → [`plan_archive/test_conventions.md`](plan_archive/test_conventions.md); §12.5 Step 13 real-data drill findings → [`plan_archive/real_data_findings.md`](plan_archive/real_data_findings.md). All three moved verbatim — relative `§12.x` pointers and "Step N above" language inside them are intentionally preserved since historical accuracy matters more than polish. Archive files open with a small header naming the split date and pointing back to this doc.

**What was extracted to live docs.** Working notes buried in the old §12.4 — the always-on `smoke.py` baseline, a `fuzz_db.py` upkeep reminder, and two gotchas (headless `Employee` construction, offscreen Qt needing `QApplication`) — moved to [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) at repo root. Expected to grow organically as more conventions and gotchas surface.

**What stayed live.** §12.1 (step status table), §12.3 (known deferred issues), and all of §13 (post-release backlog). Section numbers §12.2 / §12.4 / §12.5 kept as stub-bodied headers so commit messages and archive-file cross-references don't go stale. Every MERGE_PLAN.md pointer that referenced the moved bodies — line 6, the §12 intro paragraph, §12.3 bullets 1 and 3, and the "See §12.2 Step N" pointers in §13.1 / §13.2 / §13.3 / §13.4 / §13.7 — was redirected to the archive path. The `(Step 7c-3 §12.2)` reference inside the preserved pre-Step-16 draft at the doc tail was deliberately left alone since that whole section is already historical-preservation content.

**Verification.** `wc -l MERGE_PLAN.md` dropped from 1028 to 706; remaining `§12.2` / `§12.4` / `§12.5` hits are all section headers, back-references inside this landed-note, or the preserved pre-Step-16 draft at the doc tail; `Read` end-to-end no longer trips the 25k cap; all four archive/convention files exist and are non-empty. No code touched; `smoke.py` green unchanged.

---

Original plan for Step 16 (pre-dated by Step 17) preserved below for reference.



**Motivation.** Team reported that entering production records one at a time via the single-record dialog will be cumbersome when the floor logs dozens per day. Team proposed: shared date + action at the top of a dialog, then N rows of `(employee, target, quantity, scrap)` below, plus an "add row" button.

**Scope.** New `ProductionBatchDialog` in `production_tab.py`, reachable from a new "Batch Entry" button on the `ProductionTab` toolbar alongside whatever triggers `ProductionEntryDialog` today. The existing single-record `ProductionEntryDialog` stays as "Quick Entry" (cheap to keep, still preferable for one-off edits).

**Layout.**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Date: [____]    Action: [ Pressing     ▾]      │   ← shared header
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Employee ▾   Target ▾   Qty   Scrap   Shift ▾   ✕│  ← row 1
│  Employee ▾   Target ▾   Qty   Scrap   Shift ▾   ✕│  ← row 2
│  ...                                             │
│  [+ Add row]                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                          [ Cancel ]  [ Save ]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Resolved decisions (from 2026-04-19 session).**
1. **Shift is per-row**, inherited as a default from the previous row. The same batch can span multiple shifts (shift lead entering a full day).
2. **Target dropdown is filtered by the shared action.** Since `action` is at the top of the dialog and target-type is a function of action (`Batching` → mix, `Pressing`/`Finishing` → part), each row's target combo only lists the appropriate type. If the user changes the top-level action mid-edit, all row target-combos must be rebuilt (and any now-invalid selections cleared with a status-line warning).
3. **Atomic per-batch save.** Any validation or UNIQUE failure on any row refuses the entire batch with a per-row error listing. No partial-save semantics — makes the transaction easier to reason about and mirrors Step 7a's atomic-save philosophy for file writes.

**Implementation sketch.**
1. New class `ProductionBatchDialog(QDialog)` (or `QWidget` top-level like the existing windows) in `production_tab.py`. Mirror the `WA_DeleteOnClose` + `setAttribute` pattern used by other edit windows (Step 7c-3 §12.2).
2. Header `QHBoxLayout` with `QDateEdit` + `QComboBox` for action.
3. Scroll area whose inner widget holds a `QVBoxLayout` of row widgets. Each row = small `QWidget` subclass `_BatchRow(QWidget)` holding the 5 input widgets + remove button. Store rows in `self.rows: list[_BatchRow]`.
4. "Add row" button at bottom of scroll area: instantiates a new `_BatchRow`, pre-populates fields from `self.rows[-1]` if it exists (quantity and scrap cleared — safer default than duplicating numerical values).
5. Action-change signal (top-level combo): iterate rows, rebuild each target combo for the new target-type, clear rows whose selected target no longer appears in the new list, show a status label above the rows if any row was invalidated.
6. Save button: iterate rows, build `ProductionRecord` per row, validate each (reusing whatever validation the existing `ProductionEntryDialog` has at `production_tab.py:362`-ish — factor out into a shared module-level helper if it makes the batch code cleaner). UNIQUE-collision check per row against the current in-memory production dict **plus** the rows added earlier in the same batch. On any failure: `QMessageBox` with a per-row error listing, leave the dialog open. On full success: insert all, call `parentTab.refresh()`, close.
7. Wire a "Batch Entry" button into `ProductionTab`'s toolbar (the current quick-entry trigger remains; batch is a peer).

**Verification.** Add `production_batch_roundtrip` to `smoke.py`: construct the dialog headlessly (or bypass the UI and exercise the save-commit logic directly on a synthetic row list), seed 3–4 rows spanning two shifts, commit, save the file, reload in a fresh `MainWindow`, assert all records present. Manual test with real data: enter a batch of 10 rows against the team's file, confirm they all appear in the list and survive a save/reload.

**Known unknowns.**
- `ProductionTab` has a second entry-dialog-ish class starting around `production_tab.py:458` (not fully read during planning — it's about an "EmployeeBox + targetTypeBox + targetNameBox + actionBox" flow, so probably the "Quick Entry" alternative already). Worth skimming before starting: if it already does something batch-like, the new work may be incremental rather than greenfield.
